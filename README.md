# What is GemAutomator (ALPHA)
It's an application for [GCFW](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106530/GemCraft__Frostborn_Wrath/) that can play for you(Shadow core farming).

GemAutomator donsn't connect to game process, just use your mouse and keypad to play and read screen if talisman fragments are full. Actually only supports W1 map with almost all runs.(Runs 24/7 but some run can may take delay)

The idea is support a **system that you can create your own personalized** run for every map but this is for now still in progress.

Download the project (dev branch prefered) open GemaAtomator.exe, open the game, load your savedata, when game loads click on GemAutomator, select options(xd) and click 'Comenzar!'.
